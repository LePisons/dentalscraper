1. Data Collection Layer (VPS)
Scraping scripts run on your VPS on a schedule (e.g., every 6 hours)
Each store has its own scraping configuration and schedule
Scripts collect: prices, product info, availability, etc.
2. Data Processing & Storage (VPS → Supabase)
Raw Data Processing
Scripts clean and normalize the scraped data
Format standardization across different stores
Price normalization (if different currencies)
Image URL processing
Database Updates (Supabase)
New products are inserted
Existing products are updated
Price changes trigger entries in price_history
Failed scraping attempts are logged
3. Data Access Layer (Supabase → Frontend)
GraphQL API
Serves as intermediary between Supabase and Frontend
Handles data queries and filtering
Manages data relationships
Next.js Frontend
Fetches data from GraphQL API
Can use server-side rendering for better SEO
Implements caching strategies for better performance
Key Considerations:
Real-time Updates
Supabase provides real-time capabilities if needed
Price changes can be reflected immediately in the UI
Error Handling
Failed scraping attempts are logged
System alerts for persistent failures
Data validation before storage
Performance
Implement caching at various levels
Pagination for large product lists
Optimize database queries
Scalability
Easy to add new stores
Database can handle growing product catalog
VPS resources can be scaled as needed
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or discuss specific implementation details?
